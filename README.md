# http_bin

##Overview

This project acts like http://requestb.in to log out POST reuqests sent to it.
It use Datastore as backing Db to store history of requests.

It was created to use in replacement of requestb.in as it seemed as it not all requests were getting logged here and some seemed to be getting dropped.

/wipe - will wipe the contents saved to Db.
